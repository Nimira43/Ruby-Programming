# variables
 
# What is a variable?
#  A variable is a name we assign to an object in our
#  program. A variable is a reference to an object.
#  Variables are sometimes called pointers or identifiers
#  because they “point to” or “identify” objects.
#  The variable itself is NOT an object. It is a placeholder
#  or name for an object
